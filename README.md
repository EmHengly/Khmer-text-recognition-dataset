# Khmer-text-recognition-dataset


## Overview
This dataset contains **136,117 images** of Khmer words, specifically chosen for word recognition tasks. It supports the development and evaluation of Khmer text recognition models, focusing on high-quality word images and precise labeling. The dataset is ideal for training models to understand the unique characteristics of Khmer script, known for its intricate character shapes and complex structure.

## Dataset Details
- **Total Word Images:** 136,117
- **Font Styles:** 10 fonts
- **File Structure:** Each word image has an associated text label, stored in a single text file for convenient data management.
- **Label File Format:**
  - The label file includes two columns: `image_name` and `text_label`.
  - Each row represents an image and its corresponding Khmer word label.
- **Usage:** This dataset can be used for both training and testing Khmer text recognition models. The labeled format supports supervised learning tasks, requiring both image inputs and text outputs.

## Getting Started
1. **Download the Dataset:** You can download the dataset files from Kaggle.
2. **Unzip the Files:** Make sure to unzip the downloaded files if they come in compressed format.
3. **Explore the Label File:** The label file maps each image to its Khmer word label, allowing you to easily load and preprocess data for model training.
