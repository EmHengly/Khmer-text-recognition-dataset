## Overview
This dataset contains **136,117 images** of Khmer words, specifically chosen for word recognition tasks. It supports developing and evaluating Khmer text recognition models, focusing on high-quality word images and precise labeling. The dataset is ideal for training models to understand the unique characteristics of Khmer script, known for its intricate character shapes and complex structure.

## Dataset Details
- **Total Word Images:** 136,117
- **Font Styles:** 10 fonts
- **File Structure:** Each word image has an associated text label, stored in a single text file for convenient data management.
- **Label File Format:**
  - The label file includes two columns: `image_name` and `text_label`.
  - Each row represents an image and its corresponding Khmer word label.
- **Usage:** This dataset can be used for both training and testing Khmer text recognition models. The labeled format supports supervised learning tasks, requiring both image inputs and text outputs.
